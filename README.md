# üß† Fake News Detection Analysis using Python ,NLP,ML

## üìå Project Overview

In today's world of instant information, distinguishing between **real** and **fake** news is more important than ever. This project focuses on using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to build a model that can detect fake news articles based on their content.

Using a labeled dataset of real and fake news, this system learns patterns in language, structure, and content that can help identify misinformation.

## üìÅ Dataset: MERGED_FULL_NEWS_DATASET.csv

### üì¶ Composition:
- **Real News**: Articles from trusted sources (label = 1)
- **Fake News**: Mock/synthetic or fabricated articles (label = 0)
- **Source**: Combined from user-uploaded dataset and a small fake news sample
- **Columns**:
  - `TITLE` ‚Äì The headline of the article
  - `TEXT` ‚Äì The full body/content of the article
  - `LABEL` ‚Äì Classification: `0 = Fake`, `1 = Real`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean text (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, remove stopwords)
   - Tokenization and optional lemmatization

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF or Word Embeddings

3. **Model Training**
   - Train classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

4. **Model Testing**
   - Test on unseen data
   - Use evaluation tools like confusion matrix and ROC curve

5. **(Optional) Deployment**
   - Package the model using Flask or Streamlit
   - Create a web interface or API for fake news detection
